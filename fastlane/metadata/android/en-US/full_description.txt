	<b style="color: dodgerblue;">Iconify</b> is an android application to customize boring Android UI.
</p>
<p>Iconify was mainly created as a substratum theme to change the system icons of any aosp rom. After some time, I converted it to use as magisk module with Terminal GUI integration. But then I got bored of using substratum and terminal gui. Applying overlays without any previews made me frustrated. So I decided to make it easier for me by creating an application where I can see the previews and change anything I want. This was totally for my personal use but as people showed interest, I decided to release it in public.</p>
